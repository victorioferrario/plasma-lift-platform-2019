        The principle of plasma cosmetology is based on the use of the 4th state of the substance – plasma. It uses
        plasma arch that occurs when nitrogen and high-frequency energy meet in the air without directly touching
        the skin, about 1-2mm from the skin. The tissue is treated “sublimate” due to narrowed cold plasma effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        This way we avoid spreading unwanted heat to the surrounding areas and preserve the healthy tissue. The
        essence of the treatment is to create a controlled micro-ablation within the top layer of the skin
        EPIDERMIS.

      <p class="rounded">
        Under the action of plasma there is an artificial sublimation of tissues without heat transfer to the
        surrounding and underlying tissues, causing active production of new collagen and elastin.</p>
